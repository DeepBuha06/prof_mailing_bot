1231 Distributions Models and Its Applications: My primary research interest falls in the area of distributions\, models and its applications. My main focus was on discrimination among several univariate and bivariate lifetime distributions . One of the fundamental aspect of parametric approach is to model the data with proper distribution. Often it is assumed that data are coming from a specific parametric family and the rest of the analysis are done based on that model assumption. But choosing a particular model is quite difficult and the effect due to model mis-specification can be severe. Therefore research toward discriminating distributions is utmost important.

1330 My research endeavors primarily aim to use chiral non-collinear spin textures for next-generation spintronic devices. In particular\, we are focused on the generation of spin current from non-collinear antiferromagnets and the electrical manipulation of such antiferromagnets for magnetic random access memory applications. Usually\, we utilize the spin current from the proximal layer or even from the same layer to switch the magnetization of the magnetic materials. We are also interested in minimizing the joule heating in current-induced magnetization switching using superconductor-non-collinear antiferromagnet heterostructures which will further lead to dissipationless spintronic memory devices.
